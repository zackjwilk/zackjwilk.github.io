                    Hi! I'm Zack Wilkinson, an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at
                    Stevens Institute of Technology. I'm interested in gaining experience through
                    internship opportunitiesâ€”primarily pertaining to software development, but
                    I'm open to exploring any opportunities that will broaden my knowledge and better
                    familiarize me with real-world work environments in the CS field.
                </p>

                            spotify-helper offers multiple features to help user automate tasks on Spotify
                            like adding local files (w/ metadata) and sequencing/organizing playlists.

                            * Local Files Automator *<br>
                            Spotify Local Files Automator is a Python script that takes user input of a song
                            title and artist name and/or link to song on SoundCloud and rips the song from
                            SoundCloud, downloads it, adds metadata (title, artist, cover image), and places
                            it in the user's specified Spotify local files folder so they can listen to it on
                            Spotify (useful for unreleased songs or songs that are otherwise not typically
                            available on Spotify).
                            <br><br>
                            * Playlist Sequencer *<br>
                            Spotify Playlist Sequencer is a Python script that takes user input of their Spotify
                            User ID and name of one of their playlists and creates a clone of said playlist in a
                            more comprehensible sequence. The tracks in the new playlist can be sequenced in
                            symmetrical (increasing until a maximum and then decreasing back down until the end
                            of the playlist), ascending, or descending order based on a selected audio feature
                            (energy, danceability, tempo, etc.).
                            <br><br>
                            * Subplaylist Maker / Playlist Filter *<br>
                            Spotify Subplaylist Maker is a Python script that takes a playlist link or user's
                            liked songs and creates a filtered clone based on audio feature factors decided by
                            the user (e.g. keeping songs that have high energy, high danceability, moderate
                            loudness, and are in C major).
